# Introduction to Statistical Inference

Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions "about a population using noisy statistical data where uncertainty must be accounted for, i.e. it formulates conclusions from data and quantify the uncertainty arising from using incomplete data.

Potential sources of uncertainties include but are not limited to:

* selection bias
* poor research design
* small sample size

There are also other statistics
