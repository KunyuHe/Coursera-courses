List of Data

List collection: ["a", "b", "c"]

[1,[4, 5], 6]: list can include list, and the included list is regarded as one element, the number of elements is the length of a list

Look up for elements in lists: 
> a = [0, 1, 2]
> print(a[2])
output: 1

Lists are mutable: assign value to element in list
> list[0] = new value 

"Range":
range(x): return a list of integers that range from 0 to one less than x

Add lists;

Slicing lists:
t[a:b]: from a, up to but not including b
t[:]: keep it complete

Build a List:
# with "Append"
> stuff = list; #stuff = []
> stuff.append("a"); #stuff = ["a"]

# find if an element is in the list:
> list = [...]
> x in list
output: either True or False

# reorder a list
> list.sort() 
# reorder list in alphabetic order

# other list methods:
> len(list)
> max()
> min()
> sum()

<Strings and List>
# "Split"
> ab = "Hello World"
> list = ab.split()
> print(list)
Output: ["Hello", "World"]
(extra spaces are treated as one)
(.split("x"), slice data by parameter x)

#Double split pattern
